    "todd": '''Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.

Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. 
You there. You and me -- we should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

    "dakota": ''' Hey there to everyone reading my profile! Over my 12 years of gaming, I've probably played 800+ different games over a wide variety of consoles. 
My favorite game categories can be reduced to four key groups: Strategy games (like Fire Emblem), Fighting games (like Super Smash Bros), Co-Op games, and MOBAs (Massive Online Battle Arena games like League of Legends). 
It's in games like these that I spend most of my time, with the games that I listed being my all time favorites and the ones that I spend most of my time on. 
Just as an additional side note, I also don't enjoy playing very many zombie games or horror games (although I will play zombies if I can get used to it or if I'm with friends).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If anybody ever wants to play, just give me a shout and I'll try and get back to ya.

Wow, I really haven't updated this in quite the while now have I? Hey guys, I'm a CompE at Purdue 2021'. I play games, looking to meet new people, and otherwise nice to meet ya!

    "keitai": '''A boy falls in love with a girl.

Unable to confess, he is gifted by a deus ex machina with the girl's phone number. Never minding the strange area code, he immediately calls her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.

But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. 
In fact, she doesn't exist in this universe at all. She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC’s own AU self, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.

Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves. 
While the two chase their respective loved ones, DRAMA ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the NATURE of LOVE.

    "plagueis": '''Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. 
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. 
Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
